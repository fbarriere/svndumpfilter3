#Description:

A fork of the svndumpfilter3.py script.

#Changes

Working on a very large mono-repo split I was blocked by the time used to re-integrate
file and directory moves between projects, so I have started to modify the script in
order to split the integration step and save the intermediate dumps and filtered dumps
in order to re-use them as much as possible.
